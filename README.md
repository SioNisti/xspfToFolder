# xspfToFolder
Gets all files from a VLC xspf playlist file and separates them into folders every 80minutes (for audio cds)

there is currently a bug of somesort where some folders will go above 80 minutes. not sure how to fix in code but you can fix your folder by hand by just taking like one or two songs and moving them to another folder
